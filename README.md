# Assessment - Express/Mongoose

March 2015

This is the first and only assessment of the semester.

Also, U ask that you don't help each other or cheat.  Feel free to use any online resource but don't copy/paste answers to each other or if you find something similar online.

## Resources

The following resources are allowed:

* Dash with any docset.  We recommend atleast `JavaScript`
* Any notes you've taken so far in Evernote/Paper
* Any code you have in your previous projects
* newlearn.fullstackacademy.com (we will provide a local instance that you can use)
* All the slide decks that we've used in class

## Things we're testing

* Express App Structures 
* Express Routing and Route Methods
* Mongoose Model Configuration

## Starting

1. `npm install`
2. You can run `npm test` which will continuously run the test suite upon file updates
3. Read through the project structure, you'll be primarily working in `models/article.js` and  `routes/index.js` in that order. 
4. Start working through the tests in `test/`.  You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
5.  When you're done, zip up everything except the `node_modules` directory and respond to the email from `columbiajavascript@gmail.com` with the Zip file.

The only thing that may be confusing is that you haven't seen integration-testing before, we're using a library called Supertest that can simulate GET/POST/PUT requests.  It should be pretty obvious once you start reading the tests in the `/test` directory how it works, otherwise check it out at [supertest - github](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)

## Submitting

To submit your answers, there are two steps:

1.  Zip up the directory 
2. Send the zip file to `columbiajavascript@gmail.com` - please respond to the email that was originally sent to you.
